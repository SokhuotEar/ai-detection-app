Parallel merge sort is an advanced version of the traditional merge sort algorithm, designed to leverage multiple processors to sort data more efficiently. This approach is particularly useful for handling large datasets, as it can significantly reduce the time complexity by performing operations concurrently. Here’s a detailed explanation of how parallel merge sort works:

Overview of Merge Sort
Before diving into the parallel version, it’s essential to understand the basics of merge sort. Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by recursively dividing the input array into smaller subarrays, sorting those subarrays, and then merging them back together to form a sorted array. The key steps are:

Divide: Split the array into two halves.
Conquer: Recursively sort each half.
Merge: Combine the two sorted halves to produce a single sorted array.
Parallel Merge Sort
Parallel merge sort extends this concept by performing the divide, conquer, and merge steps concurrently across multiple processors. Here’s how it works:

1. Parallel Division
The first step in parallel merge sort is to divide the array into smaller subarrays. This division can be done in parallel by assigning different portions of the array to different processors. For example, if we have four processors, we can divide the array into four equal parts and assign each part to a different processor. Each processor then recursively divides its assigned subarray until the size of the subarrays is small enough to be managed efficiently.

2. Parallel Sorting
Once the array is divided into sufficiently small subarrays, each processor sorts its subarray independently. This step can be performed using any efficient sorting algorithm, such as quicksort or even a sequential merge sort. The key advantage here is that multiple processors are working simultaneously, which speeds up the sorting process.

3. Parallel Merging
The final step is to merge the sorted subarrays back together. This merging process can also be parallelized. Here’s a simplified explanation of how parallel merging works:

Initial Merge: Each processor pairs up with another processor and merges their sorted subarrays. For instance, if there are four processors, Processor 1 merges its subarray with Processor 2’s subarray, and Processor 3 merges with Processor 4.
Subsequent Merges: The merged subarrays are then merged again in pairs, reducing the number of subarrays by half each time. This process continues until there is only one sorted array left.
Load Balancing
One of the challenges in parallel merge sort is ensuring that the workload is evenly distributed among processors. If some processors have significantly more work than others, the overall efficiency can be reduced. To address this, load balancing techniques are used to dynamically distribute the workload based on the current processing capacity of each processor1.
